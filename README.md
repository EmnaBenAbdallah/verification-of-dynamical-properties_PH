# verification-of-dynamical-properties_PH

#### Compilation requirements
  
  - [Clasp](http://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/clasp/) is an answer set solver.
  
  - [Gringo](http://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/gringo/) Version 3.
  It is a grounder. From a given input program with first-order variables, it computes an equivalent ground (variable-free) program
  
  ##### OR
  
  - [Clingo](http://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/clingo/) Version 3.
  It combines both gringo and clasp into a monolithic system.

##### Attention! 
The languages of Gringo 3 and 4 are not fully compatible because Gringo 4 adheres to the recent ASP language standard. For processing legacy encodings, we recommend downloading the version of Gringo 3.
